		<h2>A little about the place from where I am from:<br></h2>
		So I am born and brought up at a town called Chinsurah.Its located 35 kms North of Kolkata,West Bengal and is located in the district of Hooghly.
		<h3>How to get here?<br></h3>
		For the fast moving people of our generation I have devised a tabular format,so that people can go through it easily:<br>
	
	<table border="1"  style="background-color:floralwhite;">
  	<tr>
    <th>Mode of conveyance</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  	</tr>
  	<tr>
    <td><b>By road</b></td>
    <td>After landing at <i>Netaji International Airport</i> you need to take a bus/car and take a <i>46km</i> journey to our town</td>
  	</tr>
  	<tr>
    <td><b>By rail</b></td>
    <td>The distance between <i>Howrah</i> to <i> Hooghly District Head Quarter</i> Chinsurah approx <i> 35.6 K.M. by train. From Howrah</i> Station avail the Local train to reach Chinsurah(Chuchura). Time taken to reach <i> 1 hour approximate.</i></td>
  	</tr>
	</table>

		<h3>Places of Interest in Chinsurah:<br></h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Bandel Church:One of the region's oldest Catholic Church</li>
			<li>Hooghly Imambara:Mosque with a framed clock tower</li>
			<li>Dutch Cemetry:An old cemetry belonging to Dutch people</li>
			<li>House of Bamkim Chandra Chaterjee composer of Vande Mataram.Here's a rare audio of the song being recited by Rabindranath Tagore:<a href="https://gaana.com/song/vandematram-2">Listen to it here<br></a></li>			
		</ul>	
	and so many more.......

	<h2>My reason for writing a webpage:<br></h2>
	<div>
		So,this is the 1st webapage i am creating seriously.Definitely,one of my jobs is to get the idea of creating webpages clear,but my other aim is to vent out in a creative way.Venting out is a very big requirement today in the 21st century.It doesn't reduce your "chad" or "sigma" quotient.Rather I believe its very brave of one to vent out his or her feelings.So thats what I am trying to do here.Venting out,but in a creative way bcuz people usually think that when one's venting its in a destructive manner.And I suggest that everyone should create his or her craetive space where one is free and unbound to limits.Just like Rabindranath Tagore said "Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high"*.

		<h2>PC vs Consoles(my all time favourite topic)</h2>
		Since I am an avid gamer and also I have done a lot of research on the topic,so I do think I have the right to discuss the topic with you guys.
